# React-Project
In the video file is a illustration about the website I created. So far it's simple and still in progress to analyze more. The diagram is changing the state depending on the inputs of age and hours of sleep. So the text appears and tell's you how many percent you are sleeping from the average people in the same age. It's based on a study which I also showed visually on the bottom. For all graphics that I modified I used DevExpress. 

Unfortunately I couldn't deploy the react application on heroku. The error is shown in the deployProblem file. Any help or improvement is welcome :).
